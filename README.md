Restaurant Franchise Database

The Microsoft Word document is the "User's Manual." It contains all the information you need to understand the database.

The 132_Fugulin_Victor-creare_inserare.txt file contains the code that creates all the tables and enforces the necessary constraints for the database to function properly.

The 132_Fugulin_Victor-exemple.txt file includes some SQL SELECT statements and a few data manipulation queries that showcase examples of how to use the database.

You can also find both the E-R diagram and the conceptual diagram above.
